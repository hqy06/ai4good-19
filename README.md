Here is summay of toy-porjects in this repo:
- kNN with IRIS using sklearn
- KMean with WINE using sklearn
- MLP classifier practices following the official sklearn tutorial
- MLP regresser practice following the official sklearn tutorial
- CNN using PyTorch
- vanilla RNN name classifier using PyTorch

Currently working on the writer RNN.
